# Windows-Info-Extraction-Powershell-Script
This is a Windows PowerShell script meant for collecting data after an incident or cyber attack has occurred. It is meant to be used when a computer is compromised and there is a need to extract info about that same computer.

I created this script in an Incident Response course in my Master's program.
